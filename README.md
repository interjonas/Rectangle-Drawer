# Rectangle-Drawer
This program was designed as per required project specifications. The project gudelines had stated it wanted a program with a clean and simple GUI with the ability to draw a rectangle. This program was also required to implement some customization features to the user such as color changing options, overlapping layered rectangles, and a delete option. This program's drawing logic and GUI was built from scratch and custom sized for a certain frame size. The overall goal of the project was to introduce basic UX and UI design elements as well as build a multifunctional GUI framing window.
